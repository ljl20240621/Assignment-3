# Vehicle Rental System

A web-based vehicle rental management system built with Flask, implementing MVC architecture and Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Overview

This application provides a complete vehicle rental solution with role-based access control, supporting three user types:
- **Corporate Users**: 15% discount on all rentals
- **Individual Users**: 10% discount for rentals exceeding 7 days
- **Staff Users**: Administrative access to manage users, vehicles, and view analytics

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Modern web browser

## Installation

### 1. Setup Virtual Environment

```bash
cd Assignment-3
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- Flask 3.1.0
- Pillow 10.1.0
- pytest 8.4.2
- pytest-cov 7.0.0

### 3. Initialize Data

Run the data initialization script to create sample data:

```bash
python3 data_init.py
```

This script initializes:

**Vehicles (20 total):**
- **10 Cars**: Toyota Camry, Honda Civic, BMW X5, Mercedes C-Class, Audi A4, Ford Mustang, Tesla Model 3, Nissan Altima, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Sorento
- **5 Motorbikes**: Honda CBR600RR, Yamaha YZF-R1, Kawasaki Ninja 400, Ducati Monster 821, Suzuki GSX-R750
- **5 Trucks**: Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, Ram 1500, Toyota Tacoma, GMC Sierra

**User Accounts (3 total):**
- **Staff**: admin / admin123 (Administrative access)
- **Corporate**: corp001 / password123 (15% discount on all rentals)
- **Individual**: john001 / password123 (10% discount for rentals >7 days)

**Data Files Created:**
- `data/vehicles.pkl` - Vehicle inventory
- `data/users.pkl` - User accounts
- `data/rentals.pkl` - Rental records (initially empty)

**Placeholder Images:**
Located in `static/images/` directory (car.jpg, motorbike.jpg, truck.jpg, default.jpg)


## Running the Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
flask run
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Default Login Credentials

**Staff Account:**
- Username: `admin` / Password: `admin123`

**Corporate Account:**
- Username: `corp001` / Password: `password123`

**Individual Account:**
- Username: `john001` / Password: `password123`

## Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Run specific test categories:

```bash
pytest tests/test_users.py          # User tests
pytest tests/test_vehicles.py       # Vehicle tests
pytest tests/test_integration.py    # Integration tests
```

Generate coverage report:

```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=models --cov-report=html
```

The project includes 51 test cases with 75% code coverage.

## Key Features

**For All Users:**
- User registration (defaults to Individual role)
- Search and filter vehicles by type, brand, price, status
- Real-time availability checking
- Hour-precise rental periods

**For Customers:**
- Browse vehicles with pagination
- View vehicle details and availability calendar
- Rent and return vehicles
- View rental history and invoices
- Automatic discount application

**For Staff:**
- User management (add, edit, activate/deactivate)
- Vehicle management (add, remove)
- Analytics dashboard (revenue, rentals, activity logs)
- View all rental records with overdue tracking

## Architecture

The application follows MVC pattern using Flask Blueprints:

- **Model**: Entity classes, DAOs for data persistence, service layer for business logic
- **View**: HTML templates with Jinja2, Bootstrap 5 styling
- **Controller**: Flask Blueprints for modular route handling

Data is persisted using Python's pickle module. All changes are saved immediately to ensure data consistency.

## Common Issues

**Port 5000 already in use:**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <PID>

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

**Module not found errors:**
Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed.

**Missing data files:**
Run `python3 data_init.py` to regenerate sample data.

## Development Notes

- The application uses Flask's development server (not suitable for production)
- Data persistence uses pickle (for production, consider using a relational database)
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Rental periods are calculated with hour precision
- User IDs are auto-generated based on role (STAFF001, CORP001, USER001)

## Testing Coverage

**Unit Tests (42 tests):**
- User authentication and authorization
- User discount calculations
- Vehicle rental cost calculations
- Date/time validation and overlap detection

**Integration Tests (9 tests):**
- Complete rental workflow (login, rent, return)
- Multi-user scenarios
- Discount application
- Data persistence across sessions
- Staff management operations
