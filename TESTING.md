## 📝 Test Examples

### Example 1: Unit Test
```python
def test_corporate_discount_applied(self, setup_system):
    """Test: Corporate user gets 15% discount."""
    services = setup_system
    
    period = RentalPeriod("01-01-2025 09:00", "03-01-2025 18:00")  # 3 days
    
    # Corporate user rents car
    # Base: 50 * 3 = 150, with 15% discount = 127.5
    cost = services['rental_service'].rent_vehicle("CAR001", "CORP001", period)
    assert cost == 127.5
```

### Example 2: Integration Test
```python
def test_user_login_rent_return_workflow(self, setup_system):
    """Test: User logs in -> rents vehicle -> returns vehicle."""
    services = setup_system
    
    # Step 1: User authentication
    user = services['auth_service'].authenticate("corp001", "pass123")
    assert user is not None
    
    # Step 2-9: Complete rental cycle...
    # (see test_integration.py for full implementation)
```

## 🔍 Test Fixtures

### Pytest Fixtures Used
- `setup`: Creates temporary DAOs and test data
- `setup_system`: Creates complete system with services
- `tmp_path`: Pytest built-in for temporary directories

### Example Fixture
```python
@pytest.fixture
def setup(self, tmp_path):
    """Setup test environment with users."""
    data_file = tmp_path / "test_users.pkl"
    user_dao = UserDAO(str(data_file))
    
    # Add test users
    staff = Staff("STAFF001", "Admin", "admin@test.com", "admin", "admin123")
    user_dao.add(staff)
    
    auth_service = AuthService(user_dao)
    return auth_service, staff
```

## 🎓 Testing Best Practices Applied

1. **AAA Pattern** (Arrange-Act-Assert)
   - Setup test data
   - Execute action
   - Verify results

2. **Descriptive Test Names**
   - `test_successful_authentication`
   - `test_overlapping_rental_prevented`
   - `test_corporate_discount_applied`

3. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test uses fresh data
   - No dependencies between tests
   - Temporary files for persistence

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Error conditions
   - Edge cases
   - Integration workflows

5. **Maintainable Tests**
   - Shared fixtures
   - Clear test structure
   - Minimal duplication
